1. starting screen with button to begin game
2. cutscene happens (text that says mission # slides down the screen)
3. character sprite appears (doesn't need art yet) and has 5 health points, and 3 lives until game over
4. sprite moves forward, backward, right and left with wasd
5. sprite shoots full auto when holding space bar
6. enemy sprites shoot either down towards the bottom of the screen, or at the player, or random
7. enemy sprites are destroyed after one shot
8. harder enemy sprites are destroyed after (x) shots, and can also shoot in different patterns ( you can just copy the patterns of the original enemy sprites if you wish)
9. enemy sprites slowly move downwards, and a background also moves downwards giving the effect the player is moving forwards.
10. destroyed enemys grant points
11. if possible could you script enemy drop randomization, 70% drop nothing 10% drop extra lives 10% drop health regens and 10% drop weapon upgrades
12. weapon upgrades would either increase the rpm of your firing, or increase the area in which the bullets cover. So normally you would shoot 2 bullets in the front per cycle, you would now shoot 4 similar to 1944
13. main boss that when killed you move to next level (6 levels in total)
14. thanks and if this is too much or not enough info lemme know!
